# Welcome to my personal space

I enjoy solving problems and making things happen through tech.

Basketball is my passion.

## Window to my thoughts

Will start adding bits and pieces of my thoughts here, so stay tuned.

## A little bit of the past

### Publications

First ever newspaper article of me, I think? Grateful for everyone who helped me come so far.

### Where I first built an iOS app

Take a peek into my internship journey at A*Star's Institute of High Performance Computing during my polytechnic days. Kinda cringe at what I wrote in the past.
